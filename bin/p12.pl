The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

my $solution;

my $k = 1;
while(!$solution)
{
    my $tri_num = get_triangle_numbers(n => $k);
    my $divisors = get_divisors($tri_num);
    if(scalar @$divisors > 500)
    {
        $solution = $tri_num;
        last;
    }
    $k++;
}

say "Solution = $solution" if $solution; # 76576500
